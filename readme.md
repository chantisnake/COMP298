# COMP 298  
This is the home of my COMP298 web development course.


### What this is for
I am new to web development and I want to experience the modern approach towards the web.
Also this is a good place to solidify my functional programming skill.

Basically this is the play ground for me to experiments various of different things used in modern web development.
This is the list of things I want to experiment with:
- sass (project 1)
- less (project 2, homepage, library)
- Typescript (project 2, homepage, library)
- elm
- scala.js
- binding.scala
- ghcjs

I will try my best not to use `css` and `js` in this repository. 
I hope I will be able to use all of above in some project.

### project structure

- **homepage**: the default homepage
- **library**: the library I made, to use in projects (except project 1, because I was too inexperienced at that point)
- **project**: the projects for the course
- **index.html**: to redirect to homepage, for easier deployment and more structured repo
