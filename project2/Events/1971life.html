    <p><em>A Conversation with Darby English</em></p>
    <p>Monday, September 25 at 7PM
      E.I.K., 32 Edgewood Avenue, New Haven</p>
    <p class="last-child">Yale School of Art welcomes Darby English (Carl Darling Buck Professor of Art History, The
      University of Chicago, Chicago, IL; Adjunct Curator, Department of Painting and Sculpture, Museum of Modern Art,
      New York, NY) in conversation with Mark Thomas Gibson (Artist; Critic and Assistant Dean of Student Relations,
      Yale School of Art) to discuss his book 1971: A Year in the Life of Color. English’s book explores the
      significance of two modernist painting and sculpture exhibitions of that year: Contemporary Black Art in
      America, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY and The De Luxe Show, The De Luxe Theater, Houston, TX.
      English and Gibson will discuss the role that a political movement can play in an artistic movement,
      specifically speaking to the Civil Rights movement of the 1960’s and how that influenced the “Black Art
      Aesthetic” of the 1970’s (and beyond?). They will also explore the role that abstraction plays in describing the
      Black Experience, and what roles do institutions play in curating the “Black Art Aesthetic?”</p>
