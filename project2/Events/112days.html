        <h1>1971: A Year in the Life of Color</h1>
        <h3>A Conversation with Darby English</h3>
        <p>Author of such important books as <em>How to See A Work of Art in Total Darkness</em>
          (<span>MIT</span> Press, 2007) and Consulting Curator at MoMA, Professor Darby English has a
          conversation with the Yale School of Art’s Assistant Dean, Mark Gibson, on topics raised in his book such as
          the
          role that a political movement can play in an artistic movement, specifically speaking to the Civil Rights
          movement of the 1960’s and how that influenced the “Black Art Aesthetic” of the 1970’s (and beyond?). They
          will
          also explore the role that abstraction plays in describing the Black Experience, and what roles do
          institutions
          play in curating the “Black Art Aesthetic?”</p>
        <p><strong>Darby English</strong> is the Carl Darling Buck Professor of Art History at the University of Chicago
          and
          Consulting Curator at MoMA.

        <h1>Crisis as Form</h1>
        <h3>Peter Osborne</h3>
        <p>The London based scholar in the field of aesthetic and contemporary art practice, Peter Osborne, approaches
          how
          the field of contemporary art since the 1960s has been characterized by both the attempted dissolution and the
          reflective expansion of the concept of artistic form. According to Professor Osborne, “recently, in the wake
          of
          the revisionist historiography of the exhibitions of that time, the motif of something ‘becoming form’ has
          been
          revived and applied in new critical contexts. What, if anything, delimits this expansion of the concept of
          artistic form? Might it be extended all the way to the crisis-ridden form of historical present? How today
          might
          we conceive crisis as form?”</p>
        <p><strong>Peter Osborne</strong> is Professor of Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University London.

        <h1>I Even Spotted One Woman Wearing a Hat</h1>
        <h3>Ariella Azoulay</h3>
        <p>Ariella Azoulay, author of <em>Civil Imagination: The Political Ontology of Photography</em> (Verso, 2012)
          and
          a
          scholar in the field of visual culture and photography, focuses her research on how history is told through
          visual
          mediums — photographs, film, drawings, and other visual elements — and how these provide a level of detail and
          context not provided solely by the written word. In her lecture at the Yale School of Art, Professor Azoulay
          will
          use the 1950s text A Woman in Berlin as a point of departure for tracing the visual record of massive rape
          taking
          place in Berlin at the end of World War II, creating a key to read certain photographs previously overlooked
          as
          related to rape.</p>
        <p><strong>Ariella Azoulay</strong> is Professor of Modern Culture and Media and Comparative Literature at Brown
          University. <strong><a href="http://art.yale.edu/IEvenSpottedOneWomanWearingaHat">Full information

        <h1>The Optics of The Racial Imaginary</h1>
        <h3>Claudia Rankine</h3>
        <p>Poet, author, essayist and playwright, Claudia Rankine addresses The Racial Imaginary Institute
          (<span>TRII</span>), which she co-founded in 2016 to seek to change the way we imagine race in
          the
          U.S. and internationally by lifting up and connecting the work of artists, writers, knowledge-producers, and
          activists with audiences seeking thoughtful, innovative conversations and experiences. Rankine will consider
          how
          issues of white dominance are expressed through the visual arts by looking at artists such as Alexandra Bell,
          Nona
          Faustine, Toyin Ojih Odutola, Hew Locke, and others.</p>
        <p><strong>Claudia Rankine</strong> is a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and the Frederick Iseman
          Professor of Poetry at Yale University. <strong><a href="http://art.yale.edu/TheOpticsofTheRacialImaginary">Full

        <h1>Public (Re) Assembly</h1>
        <h3>Shannon Jackson</h3>
        <p>Author of <em>Social Works: Performing Art, Supporting Publics</em> (Routledge, 2011), Shannon Jackson gives
          a
          talk on what does it mean to assemble in public in our present moment? And what does it mean to assemble
          public
          sector systems? Is there a relation between the public appearance of the former and the systematic operations
          of
          the latter? The concept of assembly is resonant, multivalent, and fraught in our current moment. Assembly
          recalls
          theories of democracy and freedom as well as modern and contemporary art movements of assemblage. It also
          invokes
          industrial (and post-industrial) processes of production, arrangement, service, and labor. Can the
          re-imagining
          of
          Public Re-Assembly help us to re-imagine how social practice is performed?</p>
        <p><strong>Shannon Jackson</strong> is a professor and researcher focusing on collaborations across art forms
          and
          the role of the arts in social change. In addition to several faculty appointments at UC-Berkeley, she is also
          Associate Vice Chancellor for the Arts + Design. <strong><a href="http://art.yale.edu/PublicReAssembly">Full
